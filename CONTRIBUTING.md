# Contributing

Welcome to this repository! The following is set of guidelines to contributing to this project. The project itself a `Student Tracking Platform` with some additional features. You should read the `Overview.md` to get an idea of the features this app will have. It uses `Next + Supabase`. If you wish to contribute then first and foremost look at any existing issues (If it fancies you then you may fix them), otherwise if you have your own enhancements to add then make an issue for those. 

- If you have any questions regarding the project you can make an issue as per templates or put it in discussion.
- I use `pnpm` but you are free to use `npm` or `yarn`. However, I suggest to use `pnpm` as well
- All the documentation should be put in `docs`. You don't need to supply documentation with each PR 
- As of right (1st October) the only thing you need to start the project is to have a Supabase account with a project 
  - In the project you can make SQL tables as per `.sql` files (TO be added)
  - As of right we only have mail authentication (Because universities usually have their own domain mails), however, for development make sure in providers of authentication only the first checkbox is checked (Don't have confirm mail on)
  - ...
- This will change drastically afterwards. So keep track
